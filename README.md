# CA Yield Contest 

This is the analysis repository for the CA Yield Contest, conducted by
B.A. Linquist at UC Davis.

The code for the analysis is public, however the data is being kept
under embargo until publication. There may be plans to anonomize
identifying information before the data is being made public

## Data

The data consist of yield results from large check plots in fields
that were voluntarily submitted to the CA Rice Yield Contest. By their
nature, these are higher yielding plots than the average CA rice
production field. However, the central question is if there are
characteristics that are related to higher yields amoungst this cohort
of high yielding plots.
